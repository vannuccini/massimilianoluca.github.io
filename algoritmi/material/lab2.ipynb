    "## Sorting algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic principle of sorting algorithms is quite simple: given an input sequence ($U$) of un-sorted elements $U=u_{1},u_{2}, ..., u_{n}$ and output a new sequence $S = s_{1}, s_{2}, ... , s_{n}$ which is a permutation of all the elements in $U$ such that $s_{1}\\leq s_{2}, ..., \\leq s_{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several sorting algorithms, the first one we will work with is **selection sort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection sort is the simplest of the sorting algorithms. The idea of **selection sort** is that given $U=u_{1},u_{2},...,u_{n}$ the algorithm loops through all the elements of $U$, finds the minimum $u_m$ and places it at the beginning of the sequence $U$, swapping $u_{1}$ with $u_m$. At the next iteration the algorithm continues looking for the minimum starting from $u_2$ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $U$ has $n$ elements, for each position $i=0,..,n-1$ in the list we need to perform the following two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (argmin) Find index of the minimum element in the sublist $U[i+1:]$, let's call it $m$ (i.e. $u_{m} = min(U[i:])$);\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (swap) Swap $u_m$ with $u_i$;\n",
    "\n",
    "A reminder on how selection sort works is reported in the following picture (taken from the lecture). Yellow cells are the minimum found at each iteration, while orange cells are those already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/pract14/selection_sort.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen in the lecture, a good implementation of this sorting algorithm has complexity $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the list to sort. Exercises 1 and 2 deal with this algorithm. "

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Insertion sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The second sorting algorithm we will see is **insertion sort**. As in the case of selection sort, this algorithm builds the solution one element at a time. It is not a very efficient sorting algorithm but it is quite simple and has several advantages like the fact that it is an *in place* algorithm (i.e. it does not need to copy the array to sort it therefore it is easy on memory), it can be efficient for *nearly sorted* lists. This is the algorithm that people use when sorting a deck of cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm builds a sorted list step by step and at each iteration it removes one element from the list placing it in the correct position within the growing sorted list. The algorithm makes use of two indexes: $i$ moving on the un-sorted part of the list and $j$, on the growing sorted part of the list.  The index $i$ starts from 1 and the loops up to the end of the list, while $j$ at each iteration starts from $i$ and goes down to finding the place where the element at index $i$ should go in the sorted list, pushing elements up while finding the right place. An element at position $h$ is pushed-up by copying $u_h$ to position $h+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an unsorted list $U = u_0, u_1, ..., u_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $i$ from 1 to $l = length(list)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. get $u_i$, store it in a temporary variable $temp$;  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. for $j = i$,...,0 push $u_{j-1}$ to position $j$ until $temp$ > $u_{j-1}$. If $j$ exists such that $temp$ < $u_j$, place $temp$ at position $j$, otherwise place $temp$ in position $0$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical representation of the algorithm (from the lecture) follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/pract14/insertion_sort1.png)\n",
    "![](img/pract14/insertion_sort2.png)\n",
    "![](img/pract14/insertion_sort3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The worst case complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is $O(n^2)$ with $n$ number of elements in the list. If one element is no more than $k$ places away from its place in the sorted array, the real complexity goes to $O(kn)$. The cost of the algorithm is therefore dependent on the sorting of the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another graphical representation of the algorithm follows (credit geeksforgeeks.org). At each iteration, red boxes are pushed to the right to make room for the green element. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/pract14/ins_sort_pic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises we will implement selection sort and insertion sort and some testing classes to check their correctness and see these algorithm in action showing their performances."
